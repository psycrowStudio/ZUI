The main premise revolves around using the content property on CSS before / after

This would be an alternative to the token find & replace method commonly used with string tables

/* CSS-esp */
.trans-welcome:after {
    content: 'Beinvenedos a el Sitio'
}

/* CSS-eng */
.trans-welcome:after {
    content: 'Welcome to the Site'
}


/* HTML */
<body>
    <p> 
        <span class="trans-welcome"></span> 
    </p>
</body>
