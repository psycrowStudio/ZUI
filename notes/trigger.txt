    == RULE ==
    TYPE: 
        * EventEquality: does an event name, and or body match a pattern
        * linkagesEquality: does a _var[] property match a pattern
        * triggerEquality: does a specific trigger match a pattern
        * objectExists: does a specific JS object exist in memory?

    STATES: 
        * pending: an async evaluation is underway
        * satisfied: evaluation is complete and satisfies the condition

    METHODS:
        * prime()^: Called automatically on init(), makes registrations, sets variables and counters, 
            * EventEquality: subscribe to _evChannel for _evName and call evaluate()
            * linkagesEquality: create
            * triggerEquality: does a specific trigger match a pattern
            * objectExists: does a specific JS object exist in memory?
        * evaluate()^: 
            * EventEquality: _evName == ev.name && ev.data === _evExactMatch || {_variables contained match _evContians }
            * linkagesEquality: does a _var[] property match a pattern
            * triggerEquality: does a specific trigger match a pattern
            * objectExists: does a specific JS object exist in memory?
        * reset()^: Called to reset the trigger to the unprimed state.
